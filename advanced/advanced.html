				<p>Rex is the Queen's favourite corgi and lives with his three other corgi companions a life of luxury at the Buckingham Palace. On a visit made by President Donald Trump with his wife Melania Trump and their own dog Mitzi, the Queen suggests that perhaps one of her corgis might prove to be a suitable mate for Mitzi, who chooses Rex, who is not pleased at all at the prospect of marrying Mitzi. After Rex evades her multiple times, Mitzi eventually chases him into the dining hall where he accidentally bites the president, deeply angering the Queen.

				Rex, feeling ashamed of having embarrassed the Queen, is consoled by Charlie, another of the Queen's corgis who is secretly jealous of Rex's position. Luring him outside the palace with the false promise that the pope in the Vatican is looking for dogs, Charlie disposes Rex's collar and Rex leaves the palace, Charlie then leads Rex into a river with the intention of drowning him. Rex is then saved by a man who takes him to an animal shelter. There, Rex's mannerisms at first alienate him from the other dogs, but after some time he soon makes friends and also falls in love with Wanda, a fellow inmate. Initially wary of Rex, she soon also develops feelings for him. This raises the ire of Tyson, a former fighting dog, who also has feelings for Wanda and runs the kennel. Rex eventually convinces the other dogs to join forces against Tyson and together they manage to overwhelm him.</p>
